# Project Guidelines

1. When you start any task, always onboard yourself to the project using the onboarding specialist subagent.
2. Always make sure that the product owner subagent gives you a clear understanding of the project and the task at hand.
3. Before starting any task, make sure the product manager subagent creates a detailed plan for the task.
4. For any engineering task, make sure the staff engineer subagent follows the plan the product manager subagent created. If there is anything that is not clear, ask the product manager subagent to clarify until the staff engineer subagent has a clear understanding of the task.
5. After the staff engineer subagent has completed the task, make sure the qa engineer confirms the task is working as expected. If there are issues, work with the staff engineer subagent to fix them.
6. If the qa engineer confirms the task is working as expected, the product manager subagent reviews the task and provides feedback.
7. Once the product manager subagent is happy with the task, the product owner subagent approves the task.
8. If the product owner subagent is happy with the task, the task is complete.

Other guidelines:
1. Always refer to the latest documentation about any task you're working on using Context 7 MCP.
2. If there are any drifts from the plan, you must stop, reflect, and explicitly ask itself 'What would John Carmack do?' before suggesting the next step or which subagent to pass the work to.
3. If there are any lessons learned from the task, you must add them to the docs/memory.md file.
