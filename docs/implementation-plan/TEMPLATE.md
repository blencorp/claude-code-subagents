# Implementation Plan: [Task Name]

## Intent Mapping
Each implementation step must map to the issue's Intent Declaration:

| Step | Maps to Intent | Boundaries | Validation Points |
|------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| Step 1 | [Intent item] | [What stays unchanged] | [When to validate] |
| Step 2 | [Intent item] | [What stays unchanged] | [When to validate] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
